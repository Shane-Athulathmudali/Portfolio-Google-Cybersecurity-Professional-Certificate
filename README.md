# Portfolio-Google-Cybersecurity-Professional-Certificate
This repository showcases my projects and hands-on labs from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Throughout the course, I gained practical skills in security foundations, network defense, incident response, risk management, and system hardening.

Professional Statement
My name is Shane Athulathmudali, and I am currently transitioning into cybersecurity. I started my journey with learning about core concepts and best practices with the CompTIA Security+ certificate and now finishing the Google Cybersecurity Professional certificate to gain hands on experience with industry tools such as network security, vulnerability assessments, and risk management.

I am now focused on securing a position as a Security Analyst, a role I believe suits my strengths in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. With my continuous education on current technologies and industry trends, I believe I will be a core asset for an organization protecting against threat actors.
